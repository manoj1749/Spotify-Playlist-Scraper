### Dart code for scraping data of playlists from spotify
- The code can be accessed through `/bin` folder
-  The code is quite understandable and we can replace the links for playlists to yours by changing the `https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/`***this part***`?$query` in the link for the playlist
